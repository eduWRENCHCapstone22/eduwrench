This page is intended to provide students information regarding
the eduWRENCH pedagogic modules, namely: 

  - [What are the prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [What are the learning objectives?](#learning-objectives)
  - [How to provide feedback?](#providing-feedback)

#### Prerequisites

The eduWRENCH modules aim to be as self-contained as possible. The only
prerequisite to the first module is that you must be familiar with the
concept of a program running on a computer for some lapse of time to
compute something of interest. The modules are intended to be done in
sequence.  Depending on your level of knowledge, you may be able to skip (or merely skim)
the earlier module(s). 

The content in these modules, especially for the earlier ones, references
classic textbooks. This is to make connections to the standard Computer
Science curriculum. Consulting these textbooks, however, is completely
optional.

Finally, these modules do not assume any computer programming knowledge or
skills, and do not involve any programming activities.  This said, the
concepts you will learn have direct implications on the development of
parallel and distributed applications.


#### Learning Objectives

The eduWRENCH modules target four top-level Student Learning Objectives (SLOs):

  - **SLO1**: Be able to explain and apply the fundamental concepts of sequential, parallel, and distributed computing
  - **SLO2**: Be able to describe typical parallel/distributed computing (PDC) applications and the platforms on which they run
  - **SLO3**: Be able to reason about and improve the performance of PDC applications 
  - **SLO4**: Be comfortable with and able to use standard tools provided as part of current CyberInfrastructure deployments

Each module, and in fact each tab within each module page, lists specific SLOs,
each mapping to one or more of the top-level SLOs. See the comprehensive
[SLO Map](XXXXX) if interest.


#### Providing feedback

You can contact us at
[support@wrench-project.org](emailto:support@wrench-project.org) to provide
feedback, even if only to let us know about errors/typos on the site.
