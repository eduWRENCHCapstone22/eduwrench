### Basics

The term **cyberinfrastructure** (CI) was introduced in the late 1990s, and 
became largely known since 2003. Although the term is still loosely defined,
all common definitions allude to systems comprising a computational 
_infrastructure_ for supporting breakthrough scientific discoveries. 
In summary, a _cyberinfrastructure_ may be composed of (but not limited to)
the following elements:  
 
- Computational systems (e.g., grids, clouds, clusters, supercomputers, etc.)
- Data and information management systems (e.g., databases, data repositories, etc.)
- Advanced instruments (e.g., telescopes, detectors, etc.)
- Visualization environments (e.g., scientific visualization, data analytics, etc.)
- Advanced networks (e.g., high-bandwidth networks, collaborative networks, etc.)
- Software (e.g., resource scheduling and provisioning, monitoring, fault-tolerance, etc.)
- People (e.g., researchers, developers, etc.)
