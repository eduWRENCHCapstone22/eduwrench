#### Target audience

The EduWRENCH modules were designed with college students in mind, starting at the
freshman level.  A current design principle is that no programming is
required. Therefore, it should be possible for younger students, e.g.,
high school or earlier, to go benefit from these modules.  

The modules aim to be as self-contained as possible: The only prerequisite
to the first module is that students be familiar with the concept of a
program running on a computer for some lapse of time to compute something
of interest.  Depending on their levels, students can skim earlier modules
or jump directly to later modules.  Although references are made to
textbooks, especially in the earlier modules, consulting these textbooks is
not required. Textbooks references are included, in part, to connect the
EduWRENCH content to the general Computer Science curriculum.

#### Learning Objectives

The EduWRENCH modules target four top-level Student Learning Objectives (SLOs):

  - **SLO1**: Be able to explain and apply the fundamental concepts of sequential, parallel, and distributed computing
  - **SLO2**: Be able to describe typical parallel/distributed computing (PDC) applications and the platforms on which they run
  - **SLO3**: Be able to reason about and improve the performance of PDC applications 
  - **SLO4**: Be comfortable with and able to use standard tools provided as part of current CyberInfrastructure deployments

Each module, and in fact each tab within each module page, lists specific SLOs, each mapping to one or more of
the top-level SLOs. See the comprehensive [SLO Map](XXXXX).

#### NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative

The [NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed
Computing](https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/) has produced curriculum
recommendations for Core Topics for Undergraduates. [Version 2.0 beta](https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=system/files/TCPP%20PDC%20Curriculum%20V2.0beta-Nov12.2020.pdf)
was released in November 2020. Below is a table that identifies which of
the SLOs therein as part of these pedagogic modules.

#### Integration into courses

There are several ways to integrate the EduWRENCH modules in your courses.
Each module includes pedagogic narratives that can be used as lecture notes.
That is, instead of lecturing on a particular
topic, students could be directed to the relevant EduWRENCH page on which
they will find relevant pedagogic material (narrative, definition,
examples, figures, simulation activities, practice questions).  Another
option is for the instructor, during a lecture, to use particular
simulation activities to illustrate particular concepts interactively, and
to go through practice questions in class (revealing answers only once
students have had a chance to participate). Each module contains several
questions without no answers provided (answers are available to instructors
upon request). These can be used by instructors in various ways including
for in-class activities, optionally with instructor-provided scaffolding,
for homework assignments, or for exam questions. All these modalities have
been already employed successfully in undergraduate university courses.


#### Running your own server

EduWRENCH is available at [on GitHub](https://github.com/wrench-project/eduwrench). Straightforward instructions
are provided in the repository's README file for deploying the EduWRENCH Web app and server. 

#### Getting help and getting involved

You can contact us at [support@wrench-project.org](emailto:support@wrench-project.org) with any questions, feedback,
or suggestions. Do not hesitate even if only to report a typo. Pull requests are of course welcome.  Also, we would very much like to hear from you if you have used these pedagogic modules in your courses, and for which kind of courses.
