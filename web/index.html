                    The goal is to achieve various learning objectives in the areas of parallel computing,
                    distributed computing, and cyberinfrastructure computing. This is achieved via pedagogic modules
                    that explore, at first elementary and later sophisticated, relevant concepts. Most modules include
                    hands-on "activities" in which students explore and experiment with simulated application executions
                    using
                    the <a href="https://wrench-project.org" target="_blank">WRENCH</a> simulation framework. These
                    modules can be used to enhance/augment existing courses, such as university or on-line courses, or
                    can simply be done in sequence by independent learners.

                    High-level Learning Objectives include: (i) Be able to explain and apply the fundamental concepts of
                    sequential, parallel, and distributed computing; (ii) Be able to describe typical
                    parallel/distributed computing (PDC) applications and the platforms on which they run; (iii) Be able
                    to reason about and improve the performance of PDC applications; and (iv) Be comfortable with and
                    able to use standard tools provided as part of current CyberInfrastructure deployments.

                    Teaching computer programming skills is not an objective of these pedagogic modules,
                    and no computer programming is required.
                    This said, the content often makes reference to
                    particular computing programming techniques, and
                    sometimes even suggests programming activities or projects.
                    This is because many of the learning
                    objectives target concepts that are fundamental for
                    developing (efficient) programs that execute or parallel
                    and distributed platforms. As a result, these modules
                    can be used effectively as part of a course that does
                    include programming learning objectives.

                    provides the necessary accurate and scalable simulation abstractions.
