## How to run Simulations in these Pedagogic Modules

When going through these pedagogic modules you will be instructed to run a particular simulation tool. This is done via
a Web application and there are two cases:

**Case #1: You have been pointed to a static Web site that hosts the Web application** (for instance by an instructor in a course): just go to that Web site.


**Case #2: You have not been pointed to a static Web site**: In this case, you must run the Web app on your machine and go to a locally-hosted Web site
    
<div class="ui accordion fluid">
  <div class="title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    (see instructions for Case #2)
  </div>
  <div markdown="0" class="ui segment content">
    {% include simulator.html %}
  </div>
</div>

Once you have navigated to the appropriate Web site, then you simply:

  - Sign in using your academic Google e-mail address (e.g., `<UH Username>@hawaii.edu`)

  - Select whatever simulation tool you were instructed to run
