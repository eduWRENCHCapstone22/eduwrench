      The goal of these pedagogic modules is for students to achieve learning objectives in the area of distributed computing, in the context of scientific workflows, via hands-on experiments. This is achieved through a set of “activities” that explore, at first elementary and later sophisticated, concepts and techniques. All these activities entail simulating workflow executions using the <a href="https://wrench-project.org">WRENCH</a> simulation framework.
